    I <em>encourage</em> it.

    Ivex is not close enough to hear the whispering.
    He doesn't seem to notice Nero casting the spell.

Mage-sight is a change in the self, but it feels like a change in the world.
Ordinary objects begin to glow with vibrant life,
and streams of shimmering energy fill the air.

<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  This place is definitely <em>not</em> an energy desert.
<<else>>
  As the wolf mage suspected, this place is <em>not</em> an energy desert.
<</if>>
The room is teeming with a form of energy that Nero has not seen before.
<<if $n_ivexGone>>
  Strands of exotic energy from

  Ivex himself is a vortex of power.
  Strands of exotic energy from

  converge on a web around the iridescent spirit of the panther,
  and his spectral arcs are embedded in
<</if>>
a complex weave of axioms that commute too
quickly for Nero to understand.
<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  His mage senses are overwhelmed. It's almost unbearably stimulating.
<</if>>

?P
The wolf recognizes <em>some</em> of the magic constructs
in the room.
Many magic axioms are invariant to substitution,
and this exotic energy seems able to act much like any other.

?P
However, <em>seeing</em> the energy is different from <em>using</em> it.
The energy's exotic harmonics have a pattern that
<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  is mysterious and tantalizing.
  If Nero were less distracted by sexual arousal,
<<else>>
  Nero did not know was possible.
  If he were
  <<if $n_subby && !$n_ivexGone>>
    alone,
  <<else>>
    in a less perilous situation,
  <</if>>
<</if>>
he might happily spend many hours, or even days,
studying this exotic energy,
and perhaps find a way to
<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  grasp it with his spectral arcs.
<<else>>
  attune his spectral arcs to it.
<</if>>

?P
<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  But his cock is straining,
<<elseif !$n_ivexGone>>
  But Ivex is waiting,
<<elseif $n_candleLit>>
  But the candle is burning,
<<else>>
  But the clock is ticking,
<</if>>
so Nero does not have time for that now.
<<if $n_candleHorny>>
  He'll have to satisfy his lust
<<else>>
  He'll have to see what he can
  <<= $n_subby && !$n_ivexGone ? "learn" : "accomplish">>
<</if>>
with just
<<= $n_candleHorny ? "adoration" : "examination">>
of this energy he cannot use.
