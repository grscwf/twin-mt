Two weeks later, the reconciled wolves estimated that the Superb Itch
had rebounded between the two approximately
<span class=nobr>6 billion</span> times,
increasing strength with each bounce, until it had gained enough
power to overcome ?msTara's
<span class=nobr>not-insubstantial</span> ward.

Two weeks after that, Nero perfected his variant of the spell,
and allowed ?msTara to test it on him.

that Nero has himself poured an enormous amount of power into it.
Nobody else has discovered the trick of it yet.
