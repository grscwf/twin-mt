The wooden cross is both a torment and a tease.
Its leather bindings are an embrace of Nero's growing arousal,
a promise of sensations beyond anything he has ever felt before.
But the cross keeps a strong grasp on his naked body
and commands him to have patience:
<em>Wait. Not yet. Hold still.</em>

?P
The wolf cannot hold still. He strains against his
<<if $n_ivexGone>>
  bonds.
<<else>>
  bonds and against the paw grasping his balls.
<</if>>
He sees himself writhing in the reflection in

on the desk.

Nero's throbbing

cock twitches wildly in counterpoint to
the shimmering of the flame of the
<<mta-no-loop [[n1y Horny Candle]]>>flickering red candle<</mta-no-loop>>
as he tries to make his erection
<em>touch</em> something, tries to give it pleasure and sensation of
anything other than the breeze of air.

<<if !$n_ivexGone>>
  ?P
  Ivex giggles hollowly at the wolf's squirmy display. The
  <<mta-no-loop [[n1y Horny Ivex]]>>muscular panther<</mta-no-loop>>
  playfully bats a paw at the
  leaky head of the wolf's cock.
  It's an intense but brief touch that has Nero gasping
  and yearning for more.
