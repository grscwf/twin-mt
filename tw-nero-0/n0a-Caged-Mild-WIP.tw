Congratulations!
You've reached an unfinished point in Nero's journey.
Thanks for playing so far!

and he will suffer new tortures when Ivex returns.
The story of this failure will be in the public release.

<<if !$n0_playerLeftStudyWithMirror && !$n0_playerLeftStudyNoMirror>>
  ?P
  Have you found the exit from Ivex's study?
<<elseif !$n0_playerLeftStudyWithMirror || !$n0_playerLeftStudyNoMirror>>
  ?P
  Have you found both ways of escaping the cross?
