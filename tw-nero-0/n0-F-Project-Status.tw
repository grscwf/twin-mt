Nero has a few Bad Endings that are already finished. Check out the Archives (in the left sidebar menu) to see which endings are available. For the endings you haven't seen yet, there are some hints on how to reach them.

We're expecting the rest of Nero's story to be released to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sleth">Sleth's Patreon</a> later in 2023. Public release will be a month later.
