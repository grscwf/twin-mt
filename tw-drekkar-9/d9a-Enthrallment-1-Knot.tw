For a moment, Drekkar feels his adrenaline shoot up. His first reflex is to bring his paw up to remove the pendant from his neck, but as he tries to do so he realizes... it doesn't work. His arm won't move, no matter how much he wills it to. Neither will the other one, or his legs, or... anything!

?P
The wolf finds himself stuck there, on all fours above the lion with his knot stuck to the feline. His mind races for a moment, his heart speeding up, but then...

?P
A thought pops up in his head. It feels... alien, however. A thought that feels like his own but is not made by him. He looks at the herbs without meaning to and, suddenly, the wolf realizes he knows what to do.

?P
Drekkar calmly lets the lion under him go. Unlike before, the feline no longer struggles or even attacks him. The lion just waits, expression as blank as before, as the wolf's arms move and his hands are placed on the floor. They're moving, but he's not controlling them!

?P
His body then starts to get up. As it does, however, there's a tug. His knot is still stuck fast to the lion. The wolf can feel everything. The jolt of pleasure the tug of his knot brings him. Usually, it would be oversensitive discomfort, but something about that candle has completely killed his refractory period. Though he can feel it, however, his body ignores it. The wolf tugs again, harder this time, trying to pull his inflated knot out of the lion who, in turn, just grunts below him. It doesn't work, however.

?P
Drekkar grows nervous watching his body place a hand on the lion's back. He knows what's coming next and grows worried, but it feels so strange to be worried and feel his body being relaxed anyway. It feels like there are two minds inside his head now, more thoughts continuing to pop up, yet the artificial thoughts take precedence over his own. If there are two minds inside his head, his own is not the one in control. The wolf starts panicking, but his body does not react to that.

?P
No, instead, his body starts pulling. Both wolf and lion grunt as the process is not easy. Still, his body is stubborn and decided. Drekkar can feel on his dick and knot how tightly the lion grips it and how uncomfortable it feels to try and pull it out before it deflates, but there is no choice. His body just keeps pulling, keeping the lion down as he pulls and pulls, until, finally...

?P
When his knot pops, a rush of his seed flows down from the lion's used and spread ass. Both wolf and lion grunt at it, but neither says anything or shows any expression. Instead, both of them stand up. The wolf grows more and more worried as, no matter how much he fights, his body won't obey.

?P
Another thought pops up in his head. Then another, then another. They become more and more constant, taking his body over. The wolf finds himself looking at the herbs and realizes that, somehow, he knows what to do, even if he didn't before.

?P
Drekkar walks. Without his consent, his body walks towards the cabinets, opens one at the top, and pulls out a mortar and pestle he didn't know were there, but at the same time, did. The wolf's mind has trouble even grasping what's going on, but there's no choice. New thoughts keep coming to his head, thoughts that aren't his, but that overcome his own, taking the forefront whenever they pop up. It feels as if... as if there are two minds in his head at the moment, and the one in command is not his!

?P
All the lupine can do is watch his body bring the mortar and pestle to the counter and set it down. He can feel the touch of the herbs on his hand as usual when his body grabs a handful and throws it in. By his side, the lion is doing the same thing, going back to grinding his own batch. He's expressionless and, when the wolf is forced to glance at the lion, Drekkar realizes... he has the same blank expression on his own face. And he can't change it, no matter how hard he tries.

?P
His body starts grinding herbs next to the lion and there's nothing he can do about it. The gemstone on the pendant... it must be the gemstone! But removing it is out of question. His body won't obey.

?P
Drekkar is trapped.
