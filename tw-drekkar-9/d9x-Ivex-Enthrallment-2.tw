Deciding to test things out before pushing anything further, the wolf grabs Ivex by his scruff and pulls him up to his knees. The panther stands firm on them, but says nothing and does not change his expression. He does seem to be completely at the wolf's mercy.

?P
Placing the bound captive properly in front of him, the wolf keeps one hand on his head holding his fur, but with the other... he points his hard, red member down towards Ivex.

?P
"Let's test this out by asking you to do something you would never do," the wolf continues with a smirk. Then, he takes half a step forward so that the tip of his member is almost touching Ivex's nose.

?P
"Lick my cock."

?P
The panther does not look at him or show any kind of emotion, again just like the lion, but he also does not hesitate for a second before leaning forward, taking his tongue out and lapping at the wolf's cock. The wolf winces. The panther's tongue is kind of rough, but the texture still feels great against his member. All of the burning arousal lingering inside the wolf gets lit up as his cock is stimulated.

?P
The red, tapered member throbs in response to Ivex's continuous licking. The panther does a thorough job, covering the wolf's member in saliva. At first, Drekkar is wary, keeping a tight grip on Ivex's fur, ready to pull him off of him at the first sign of aggression, but after a few minutes of constant licking, it is clear that the spell works. The wolf's grip loosens and, as it does, the panther leans forward to increase his reach. His tongue caresses the whole of the wolf's member, coating it all the way to the knot. Feeling that rough tongue right against his sensitive knot has Drekkar gritting his teeth as a bead of pre-cum appears at the tip of his member. His arousal flares higher and higher and, seeing Ivex in that position...

?P
There is little to do but take advantage of it.
