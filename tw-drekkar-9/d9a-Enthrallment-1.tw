The lion stands chest to chest with the wolf and brings the pendant up. Drekkar reluctantly allows the feline to put it over his head and around his neck.

?P
Looking down at it, the wolf can see the blue gemstone glowing brighter. It is as if there is a mist inside it that glows and whirls. At first, nothing happens.

?P
The lion stands there, not moving and not saying anything, watching the wolf as if expecting something. It is only when Drekkar tries to speak that he realizes something is wrong.

?P
His mind wants to speak, but his muzzle does not obey. With urgency, the wolf raises his hands up to feel his muzzle, but midway towards it, his hands stop. His arms grow limp, resting by his sides without him meaning to. Adrenaline starts shooting up the wolf and the urge to move grows, but his legs stop responding as well. He's forced to just stand there! Drekkar growls, looking at the lion, and then...

?P
A thought pops up in his head. It feels... alien, however. A thought that feels like his own but is not made by him. He looks at the herbs without meaning to and, suddenly, the wolf realizes he knows what to do.

?P
Drekkar walks. Without his consent, his body walks towards the cabinets, opens one at the top, and pulls out a mortar and pestle he didn't know were there, but at the same time, did. The wolf's mind has trouble even grasping what's going on, but there's no choice. New thoughts keep coming to his head, thoughts that aren't his, but that overcome his own, taking the forefront whenever they pop up. It feels as if... as if there are two minds in his head at the moment, and the one in command is not his!

?P
The wolf grows more and more worried as, no matter how much he fights, his body won't obey. Drekkar can feel himself relaxing, no longer nervous, even though he wants to be. His other mind isn't.

?P
All the lupine can do is watch his body bring the mortar and pestle to the counter and set it down. He can feel the touch of the herbs on his hand as usual when his body grabs a handful and throws it in. By his side, the lion is doing the same thing, going back to grinding his own batch. He's expressionless and, when the wolf is forced to glance at the lion, Drekkar realizes... he has the same blank expression on his own face. And he can't change it, no matter how hard he tries.

?P
His body starts grinding herbs next to the lion and there's nothing he can do about it. The gemstone on the pendant... it must be the gemstone! But removing it is out of the question. His body won't obey.

?P
Drekkar is trapped.
