:: d9x Enthrallment Vengeance (Text) [text] {"position":"13300,6000","size":"100,100"}
Deciding on his vengeance, the wolf smirks. While the panther is still unconscious on the floor, the wolf turns towards the tower inside the gemstone, picks the red teleportation stone up and clutches it again.

$name finds the transportation easier this time. Perhaps because he was ready for it? Regardless, the wolf turns up at the exact same spot he left. From there, it is a simple matter to return to the lion's room where the large feline still squirms on the ground.

"The master's pendant must be worn by his thralls at all times," the lion says to him when he enters, as always.

The wolf just rolls his eyes. "Yeah, the master's pendant will be put to good use," $name replies as he picks up the blue glowing pendant the lion had made for him. The feline does little more than follow him with his eyes and repeat his line when the wolf turns away to leave.

"I'll come back and deal with you once I've dealt with the mage," the wolf promises as he clutches his gemstone again and teleports outside once more.

Once out, $name can see that Ivex woke up in the meantime. The moment $name appears, the panther looks at him with that same look of surprise and fear. He had already clearly been wiggling to try and get out of the ropework the wolf had left him in, but he redoubles his efforts to do so as $name approaches.

"Get away from me!" Ivex hisses. Surprisingly, some of the arrogance still lingers in his tone. It only makes what the wolf is planning to do feel even better.

Without even saying anything, $name gets close to the panther, crouches down... and brings up the blue pendant.

Recognition flares up in Ivex's eyes right away.

"What?! How did you get that?! No! NO!" He shakes his head and tries to wiggle and crawl away from the wolf as soon as he sees it.

"Yes," the wolf says, easily grabbing the panther, pulling his bound self close and bringing the pendant up to him...

"NO! Get that thing away from me! You don't know what you're doing!" Ivex almost pleads.

The wolf doesn't stop.
