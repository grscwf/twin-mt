The wolf can't even turn his head to look at the damned mage, but the panther is incredibly happy and amused to find him there with a gemstone around his neck and working next to the lion.

There is nothing Drekkar can do. Ivex compliments the lion for capturing him with a slap to the feline's bare ass. The wolf is forced to remain there, grinding herbs while Ivex's hands explore his helpless body, stroke and play with his forcefully aroused cock and even go as far as shoving a finger up his ass.

The wolf can't growl, can't speak, can't do anything about it! It hurts his pride to no end.

Ivex decides there and then to keep him as a thrall, saying the lion had been needing company anyway and Drekkar was just as nice to look at. The mage then goes and grabs a set of leather straps he calls a 'uniform' to outfit the wolf with.

Much to Drekkar's dismay, whatever order Ivex issues, the parasitic mind created by the necklace makes his body obey right away. The wolf has never tried so hard to will his body to punch someone as he does when Ivex makes him lift his arms, turn this way and that, and even lift his tail while he puts the leather gear upon his body. Just like the lion, his 'uniform' consists of little more than a leather harness. Unlike the lion, however, the wolf gets nothing more than a metal ring around the base of his balls that keeps them uncomfortably pulled forward, making them more exposed. The discomfort is still felt by the wolf, but Ivex? He merely pats the wolf's exposed nuts and laughs, saying he'll enjoy looking and playing with them in the future.

After that, there is nothing else the wolf can do. Removing the pendant is impossible by himself and Ivex surely won't do it. Drekkar finds himself doomed to serve as the perverted mage's thrall against his will.
