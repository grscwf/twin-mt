It doesn't matter how much the wolf shouts and yells inside his thoughts or how much willpower he puts into defying his body's movements. It won't obey. Whatever that pendant is, it's strong enough to overcome him entirely.

?P
Drekkar is forced to remain there next to the lion in the exact same state the leonine warrior is in. Blank expression and mindlessly grinding herbs for Ivex's nefarious purposes. Like... like some sort of slave. Like a mindless fucking thrall! The thought alone is enough to drive the wolf mad with anger, but his heart does not even speed up. It feels so unnatural to feel these things without really feeling them!

?P
Everything about it is unnatural. Invasive! And the worst part? Drekkar can tell that there's more to the pendant too. All around him, the smell of herbs that were already prevalent in this room now feels enhanced. His sensitive canine nose can pick it up very well, and it grows even stronger when he grinds them. The smell comes out of them and when it does...

?P
For some reason, that smell feels incredibly <b>arousing</b>. If he could look at the lion by his side, he would. The wolf starts to understand why the lion was hard and dripping the whole time while working. He himself cannot help it. His cock throbs between his legs, unattended, but the arousal is there, coming from the herbs he's forced to grind. With how boring the work is, the lust surrounding his body is the only thing his mind can focus on. It feels like torture to feel it and be completely unable to even get close to tend to it.

?P
No matter how much he tries, Drekkar cannot find a way out. He's trapped there grinding herbs and getting aroused by it until who knows how long after that, Ivex himself opens the door.
