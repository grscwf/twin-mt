Drekkar takes his sweet time. He is definitely not in a hurry anymore. The wolf enjoys the feeling of the panther's ass around his cock, the way it grips his grown knot, and the way it clenches while Ivex continues to try and try to jerk off to no avail.

While waiting for his knot to recede, he looks at the feline. Ivex stares at nothing in particular while his hand continues to tease and work his sheath. His cock, stuck inside it, looks absolutely desperate to grow, but the magic barrier keeping his sheath sealed is strong. The barrier, however, does not seem to apply to liquids, as a steady flow of pre-cum keeps coming from Ivex's sheath to run down towards Ivex's balls and, much to his annoyance, mat the fur of his crotch as well.

"You are a feline. Felines are flexible, aren't they?" Drekkar idly asks.

"Yes," Ivex answers.

The wolf smirks. "Then clean this mess you made with your tongue."

It is incredibly amusing to see Ivex bend forward. In an impressive display of flexibility, the panther indeed does reach beneath his own balls with his muzzle and, as always without hesitating, starts licking up his own pre-cum from the wolf's fur.

Drekkar growls. His cock throbs with lust at the sight of the mage being made to do that. Ivex's lust spell is keeping his knot well engorged, and a desire to fuck him for a second time comes over the wolf, but he decides against it. At least not for now. Drekkar is content to just lay back and watch Ivex's licking move up to his own balls. The panther licks up every drop of pre-cum from them,  and then he reaches his own sheath.

From there on, things get more amusing. Ivex lets out a small groan as his tongue laps over his own sheath. His member tries and tries to grow, but stopped by his own spell, the feline's tongue can only clean the pre-cum from his sheath while stimulating himself and, as he does, more pre-cum keeps coming from his cock for him to lap up. The wolf lets out a small laugh at the sight. He leaves the panther on that little loop for a good while.

Eventually, Drekkar realizes that his knot will, in fact, not recede. The panther will stay there licking his own trapped sheath for hours if he lets him. With a sigh, the wolf grabs the panther's hips again and gets ready.

"This will be quite uncomfortable for you," Drekkar says without an ounce of actual sorrow over it. "Pull yourself off my knot."

The enthralled panther finally stops licking himself to sit up straight. Then, putting both his paws on the wolf's abdomen, starts trying to rise up. The wolf grunts, feeling the tug on his knot, but slowly, carefully, and with a lot of uncomfortable grunting on Ivex's part, eventually, the wolf's knot finally pops out of his rear. The moment it does, some of his seed runs down from the panther's rear, but the wolf is quick to order Ivex to stand up properly and get off of him.

Standing up himself, Drekkar looks down at the mage. With the wolf's seed running down the back of his thighs, he smirks.

It's time to take Ivex back to the Wayward Adventurers Guild. Watching the blank-faced mage and knowing he's trapped like that, however, the wolf gets to thinking...

What would it be like to have a thrall himself? Would a large bag of gold really be enough to make up for something like that? What if...?

No, that wouldn't be right. ...Would it? Ivex has made thralls of others and he had no intention of letting them go. It is poetic justice that he ends up meeting the same fate. Besides, slaves are common in most cities. Wouldn't that be a fitting punishment for the mage after all he's done?
