A smile grows across the wolf's muzzle. Yeah, there is no reason to waste such a good thrall by delivering him in for gold. Thinking back on all Ivex did to him in the tower and, even more so, what Ivex planned to do to him still, fills the wolf with certainty that this is the right way to go about it.

?P
"This is a pretty look for you," Drekkar comments. "You don't mind staying naked, do you? I think I might just keep you naked all the time. It's not like you will mind all the stares, right?"

?P
"No, master," Ivex answers blankly, and the wolf laughs again.

?P
"Even if your ass is leaking my seed after I fuck you?"

?P
"No, master."

?P
"That's what I thought."

?P
With a wide smile, the wolf makes Ivex himself gather everything. The mage finds him a ragged pair of pants in the farmhouse that is enough to hold out until he can find something better. It takes some effort for the wolf to tuck his still hard cock inside, but that is another thing the panther can take care of again soon enough.

?P
Drekkar packs everything. The sack of gemstones with Ivex's spells and the large gemstone containing his tower. All of that along with, of course, the panther himself.

?P
Ivex, with the pendant around his neck, is made to walk behind the wolf the whole way. Never before had delivering a bounty been so easy. True to his word, the wolf leaves the panther completely naked. There is no point in wasting gold buying clothes for someone that does not deserve them.

?P
The journey back to the Wayward Adventurers Guild is a few days long and the wolf is not in a hurry to return. In fact, Drekkar makes a point to include as many towns as he can on the way back and, each time, he takes immense pleasure in watching the stares of folk as they see the naked panther parading around the city. In one of them, the wolf went as far as ordering the panther to clutch a gemstone containing a lust spell so he was mewling and dripping the whole time as well.

?P
When they arrive back in the Guild, the wolf delivers Ivex's tower and his gemstones to the official mages, but claims that he could not capture Ivex himself. It fills him with pleasure to know that he, in fact, left the panther jerking himself off in the alley behind the building.

?P
The mages handle his tower. The wolf does not stick around to see it, but the rumors of the insane tower a mage possessed spread like wildfire. Apparently, the mages of the Wayward Adventurers Guild had to go through an arduous, delicate process to save the over fifty people Ivex had trapped inside his tower. All of them males. It makes Drekkar feel all the better for having such a previously dangerous and deranged mage at his disposal, ready to lick his feet if he feels like it. Literally.

?P
With a new 'companion' by his side, the wolf moves on. The life of an adventurer is like that. Ivex wasn't the first mage he had to fight and it won't be the last. The events of the tower stick inside Drekkar's mind, though, and they are enough to make him blush every now and then, but whenever that happens, his new panther servant is there to alleviate his rage. He will make sure that such things never happen again.

?P
Or, at least, he will try to.
