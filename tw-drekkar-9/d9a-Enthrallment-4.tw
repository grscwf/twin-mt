Time loses all meaning to the wolf. Inside Ivex's tower, it's impossible to tell day from night. His body sleeps sometimes, but the intervals at which he does seem random and, sometimes, get interrupted by Ivex's orders if they are particularly lengthy.

?P
Little by little, the unwilling wolf learns more about the mage, but every new thing he learns just makes him hate him more. Drekkar gets by telling himself that, as soon as he's free, he's gonna get his revenge on the mage, except that the days keep going by and freedom never comes.

?P
At first, Ivex takes a lot of pleasure in just making the wolf do tricks for him. Making him dance, giving him clothes to put on, just so that he can strip for him, ordering the wolf to exercise, often way past even Drekkar's considerable limits, just for his own amusement. As always, the wolf can <b>feel</b> everything, but stop none of it.

?P
It gets worse when the mage moves on to more... invasive things. Forcing the wolf to jerk off for him is bad enough, but the mage seems to also take immense pleasure in ordering the wolf to jerk off and then making him stop halfway through. Ivex is definitely aware that Drekkar's mind is intact behind his body, for he often talks to the wolf as if he had any choice in any matter, just to further insult and humiliate him.

?P
Life under Ivex's command is absolute hell to the wolf. Days and days of grueling work grinding his herbs, making his potions, or just carrying around his things around his tower. Whole nights edging himself and unable to get release for Ivex's amusement at the corner of his office while he works, with the worst one being the one when the mage falls asleep on his desk and forgets the wolf was there doing that, leaving Drekkar to spend an entire night of relentlessly jerking off and edging without being able to release, move or otherwise even say anything against it.

?P
There's the lion as well. Overhearing Ivex's comments to him, Drekkar finds out his name is, or was, Aidham. The wolf can only guess he must have been an adventurer that tried to fight Ivex just like he is, but in the end, failed, and now has fallen under Ivex's spells as well.

?P
Activities with the lion end up being quite common as well. The mage takes pleasure sitting back and jerking off while watching the two of them fuck each other under his orders in any position he can imagine. Neither warrior has any choice in the matter but to watch their bodies obey and feel everything as the mage uses them for his own pleasure.

?P
Time keeps passing, each day a new set of orders with some being worse and some being better. Still, Drekkar's own mind waits. His current system is counting the number of punches he's gonna give Ivex when he gets free, but as of right now he's beaten a thousand and is still going. Still, someday... someday freedom will come and he'll be able to settle the score. Someday, somehow.
