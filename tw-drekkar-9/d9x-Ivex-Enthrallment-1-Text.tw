"YOU FOOL!" Ivex yells as the pendant is brought up to his head. "When I get out of this, I will make you regret all of this a thousand times ov-"

$name lowers the pendant, placing it around his neck. The gemstone emits a glow for a moment and, as soon as it does, Ivex's eyes grow wide for just a moment and his words get interrupted. Then, soon after, his expression of outrage and anger fades into a neutral one. The same one the lion holds all the time.

All signs of struggling fade and the panther relaxes in his bonds. Then, Ivex's eyes lazily shift towards the wolf, but he says nothing.

"Ivex?" $name asks, and only when he does, the cat speaks.

"Are you master?" he asks.

Taken aback by the question, the wolf thinks for a moment, but nods.

"Yes?"

"You are master," Ivex simply states in a monotone voice that carries little emotion behind it. Then, the feline stands still. "The master desires herbs ground for the attunement potions," he says.

"Herbs?" the wolf asks. He thinks back to the lion. That explains his behavior... "No, no potions are necessary," the wolf then states.

"No potions are necessary," the feline repeats, and then he remains still.

The wolf stands up and looks down at him curiously. Does this thing really work? Just as he did with the lion, he attempts to remove the pendant from Ivex's neck, but it does not go past his neckline, as if some kind of invisible barrier prevents it from doing so, making it unremovable by conventional means. Surely more of Ivex's magic to keep his thralls secure. How ironic that it now works against him.

Watching the bound feline standing still and without expression, the wolf smirks. A series of ideas go through his head and, underneath him... his cock throbs. The arousal Ivex has inflicted on him has been bothering him ever since he escaped that damned cross.

Maybe it's time to do something about that, too.
