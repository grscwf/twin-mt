The Gravity Crystal immediately drops down to rest on top of the
Dream Crystal, which is the position the Dream Crystal says
it should have.

Nero's balls try to follow. The sounds emerging from the wolf's
muzzle are an unintelligible babble of screaming vowels
all blurred together.
His breath is fast and shallow. When he inhales,
the pitch of the sound changes, but the vowels never stop.

The wolf's body tries to crouch down to relieve the pull on his balls.
His legs and torso tremble with exertion.
His wrists rub fresh bruises into the edges of the leather straps.
His arms complain violently about this unaccustomed stretch.

and the pain of that strain competes with the pain of
the impossible stretching at his groin.

with the suffering below, but his body is not that stable.
He quivers, and the unbearable sensations ebb and flow.

and then he moves again to shift the new misery somewhere
else again.
He twitches an endless screaming dance in the leather bonds
on the wooden cross.

in ways that it cannot, but it still feels a great
aching torment from attempting that impossible effort.

but it still has the weight of something much larger,
and its slight oscillation is enough changing stress
to prevent his balls from settling into
a comfortable ache that will let them recover.
