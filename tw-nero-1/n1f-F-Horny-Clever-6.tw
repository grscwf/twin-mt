The Gravity Crystal immediately drops down to rest on top of the
Dream Crystal, which is the position the Dream Crystal says
it should have.

Nero's balls try to follow. The sounds emerging from the wolf's
muzzle are an unintelligible babble of screaming vowels
all blurred together.
His breath is fast and shallow. When he inhales,

The wolf's body tries to crouch down to relieve the pull on his balls.
His legs and torso tremble with exertion.

than its small size would suggest.
And the oscillation prevents his balls from settling into
a comfortable ache that will let them recover.
