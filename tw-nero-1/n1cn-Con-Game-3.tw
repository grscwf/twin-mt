Ivex tilts his head and stares at the

wolf for a long moment.

"That is an interesting idea you've presented to me."

one hand on the buckle of an ankle strap.

The panther continues. "I was certain you were a mage.

  very convincing.

But what you're telling me now...

He toys with the buckle, as if considering whether
