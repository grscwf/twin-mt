  Ivex suddenly asks, "Is the secret council's mind control based on
  inhibition or repression?"
<<n1-remind>>
  Ivex wants to know if the secret council uses inhibition or repression
  to prevent their minions from divulging the secret.
<<n1-repeat>>
  Ivex says, "This is not simple curiosity.
  I <em>must</em> know. Is the guild's secret kept with
  inhibition or repression?"
<<n1-warn>>
  Ivex's tail is twitching with annoyance. "Inhibition and repression have
  different implications for my experiments. Are you unwilling or unable to
  tell me which variety of mind control you use?"
<<n1-insist>>
  Ivex snarls, "Tell me! Are you using inhibition or repression to..."
  He shakes his head in exasperation.
  "Of course you don't know. Why am I wasting my time
  asking a <em>minion</em> what his invisible chains are."
