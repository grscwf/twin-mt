Nero is
<<= $n1_abused ? "relieved" : "happy">>
that Ivex has moved away from thoughts of
repression.
Defense against repression is a matter of holding onto a memory
and strengthening its connections, while the adversary is trying to sever
those connections and tear the memory away. It's not a subtle sport,
and cleverness does not help. Power and determination wins the day.

<<if $n1_mageSight>>
  The wolf is
  <<= $n1_abused ? "" : "slightly">>
  intimidated by the massive flows of
  exotic energy that Ivex has in his lair.
  Nero does not
  <<= $n1_abused ? "think" : "know if">>
  he can win a power battle here.
<<elseif MP_triedMagic === $n1_magicPhase>>
  The wolf is feeling depleted from the failure of ?spell.
  He does not
  <<= $n1_abused ? "think" : "know if">>
  he can win a power battle right now.
<<else>>
  The wolf is wary of engaging in a power battle in
  a place that Ivex has prepared for it. Nero does not
  <<= $n1_abused ? "think" : "know if">>
  he can win that battle.
<</if>>
?P
Defense against <em>inhibition</em> is completely different.
Power is irrelevant in that battle.
It's a more complicated fight, but cleverness is Nero's strength,
and he's
<<= $n1_abused ? "more" : "">>
confident he can prevail in that one.
?P
And he might not even need to fight at all! Ivex seems quite taken by
this tale of a secret council.
All that Nero needs to do now is wait for the panther
to make a simple mistake.
