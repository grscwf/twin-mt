Ivex laughs. "Your plan to become my apprentice begins by
irritating me with a pitiful attack spell?"

Nero thinks quickly.
<<if $n_abused>>
  <<run MT.waypoint(9, "abused")>>
  "I wanted to be sure you were as powerful as it seemed
  from your dossier. And Superb Itch is quite harmless, really!"
<<else>>
  <<run MT.waypoint(10, "not abused")>>
  "The tales of your feats in your dossier were clearly
  some sort of mundane misinterpretation of magic.
  It was clear that you aren't just some carnival wizard,
  but I was less certain if you know magic that I do not.
  I'm quite impressed."

  ?P
  Ivex frowns. "Still, you <em>attacked</em> me.
  Were you unable to think of a friendlier test?"

  ?P
  Nero replies, "Superb Itch is a harmless little spell,
  as I'm sure you know."

<<if $n_ivexNear>>
  <<run MT.waypoint(11, "near")>>

<<else>>
  <<run MT.waypoint(12, "not near")>>
  He approaches with a bared-teeth grin
  that does not reassure the wolf.
