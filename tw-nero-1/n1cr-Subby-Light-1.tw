  "Within reason..."
  ?P
  Nero was initially hesitant about showing even a tiny sign of
  resistance to the abusive panther's demands.
  But the wolf has decided:
  When he finally does escape this place,
  he wants to look back and remember
  that he remained true to himself,
  that he did not shamefully debase himself
  for this vulgar villain.

<<elseif $n_naked>>
  "Within reason," says the wolf with confidence.
  ?P
  He's acutely aware of his nakedness in the moment,
  a condition that Ivex was very quick to create.
  And the wolf can guess the variety of sordid acts
  the panther would like to include in that <em>everything</em>.
  ?P
  Nero does not want to encourage such thoughts,
  but he <em>does</em> need to agree to obedience.
  The wolf hopes that a firm declaration of an ambiguous boundary
  will make the panther hesitate.
  Of course, Ivex has already demonstrated an interest in
  crossing boundaries,
  but Nero thinks that Ivex can be distracted by the game
  of guessing whether an action <em>will</em> cross
  the unspoken boundary or not.

<<else>>
  "Within reason," the wolf says cautiously.
  ?P
  Nero of course does not expect to actually become an apprentice,
  but he does not know how long he'll need to maintain the pretense.
  The lie will be more plausible if he conveys an understanding of
  the sensible boundaries he'd expect in any apprenticeship,
  whoever the mentor or apprentice might be.

?P
Ivex chuckles. "A polite answer. And perhaps sincere as well.
But I wonder, <em>whose</em> reason is to be the guide.
Yours or mine?"

?P
Nero senses a trap. He does not know if he can avoid it.
"I use my own reason. I do not think you would
want a stupid apprentice. But of course I will defer to
your greater wisdom when my reasoning is flawed,
and I trust that you will explain to me the flaw."

?P
Ivex tilts his head to consider the wolf. After a moment,
<<if $n_ivexNear>>
  he waves an arm, and
  <<if $n_mageSight>>
    strands of exotic energy lift a metallic letter opener off
    the desk, bringing it to

    a metallic letter opener flies from the desk to land in

  his paw.
<<else>>
  he picks up a shiny letter opener from the desk and
  approaches the wooden cross.

"You are correct," says the panther.
"I do not need a stupidly obedient apprentice.
My lion already fills that role.
So let us test your intelligence..."
