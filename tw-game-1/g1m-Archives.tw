    Here you can revisit all the endings and keywords
    that the adventurers have seen
    in their time in the Mage's Tower.
    When an adventurer experiences an ending,
    it will be unlocked here.
    If an ending has different variations
    due to the adventurer's choices during the game,
    these also can be set here,
    provided they have been seen before.
    ?P
    Grayed out endings and variations are paths
    that have not yet been found.
    Most of them are shown with a hint
    as to what path the adventurer should take to reach them.
    There are also many hints within the stories for each path.
    ?P
    The endings in this archive are all static,
    with no choices beyond the selection of variations on this page.
    A few of the actual endings have choices
    that are more complicated than what can be selected below.
    If you want to re-experience those dynamic endings,
    not just the static version offered here,
    you can save a game at the point the ending begins.
