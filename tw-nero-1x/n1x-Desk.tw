does not have joints or seams, and the wood grain
is continuous and uninterrupted across all of the desk's visible surfaces.

  Despite the appearance, which does not seem to be an illusion,
  the material is something much stronger than wood.
  Nero was unable to damage it in any way.
  He does not know what the substance can be.
  
<<elseif $n1_mageSight>>
  The wood oddly does not seem to be an illusion.
  Maybe it <em>is</em> carved from a single, massive block of wood?
  But the material glows strongly with exotic energy,
  so perhaps it's something else that merely resembles wood.
<<else>>
  It appears to have been carved from a single, massive block of wood,
  which is an unlikely construction for such an ordinary object.
  It's probably just a sloppy magic veneer applied to a normal assemblage
  of cheap lumber.

    bare.

    The pillar was formerly in the snow globe
    from the Caverns of Lusty Spires,

    <em>to</em> the Caverns of Lusty Spires.

  The missing heirloom might be in the desk?
  There are no obvious drawers or doors,

    Nero has... searched the desk as well as he
    can right now.
    ?P
    A mage like Ivex is likely to have some
    magical way of opening the desk.
    If the heirloom <em>is</em> in the desk,
    Nero will have to try later,
    when he has more magic.
  <<else>>
    Nero has... searched the desk for hidden catches,
    but has not found any.

  Perhaps the missing heirloom is in the desk?
  Most people would not put something so valuable in a place so ordinary.
  But Ivex is not most people.
