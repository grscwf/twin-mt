Propped up against the
<<n1-no-loop [[?globe|n1x-F Globe]]>>
<<if $n1_candleLit>>
  behind the
  <<n1-no-loop [[flickering red candle|n1x-F Candle]]>>
<</if>>
on Ivex's desk, there's a ?mirror
about the size of a playing card.

<<if $n1_mageSight>>
  <<if $n1_mirrorMagicKnown>>
    For some reason, an illusion of plain dark wood is covering
    the elegant mage-silver frame, which is shaped like a
    rectangle with rounded corners.
  <<else>>
    The frame appears to be plain dark wood, but mage-sight
    shows the wood is an illusion covering mage-silver.
    <<if $n1_mirrorViewed>>
      This actually <em>is</em> a magic mirror.
    <<else>>
      This plain-seeming mirror is actually a magic mirror!
    <</if>>
  <</if>>
  ?P
  Nero wonders why Ivex would cover the elegance of
  mage-silver with an illusion, and why the illusion
  is cheap wood, when it could be anything at all,
  perhaps a gem-encrusted monstrosity that seems to be
  more the panther's style.

<<else>>
  The frame is plain dark wood and shaped like a rectangle
  with rounded corners.
  ?P
  Nero wonders why Ivex would have such an object on his desk.
  The frame is too cheap for it to be a magic mirror.
  Perhaps it's simply vanity?
  But then why not have a mirror on the wall?
<</if>>

?P
In any case, the wolf is lucky that the mirror is placed
at an angle that allows him to see
<<if $n1_gravNoticed>>
  <<= $n1_naked ? "his naked self," : "himself,">>
  as well as an interesting arrangement of
  <<if $n1_gravAsked>>
    [[Gravity Crystals|n1x-F Grav]]
  <<else>>
    [[glowing crystals|n1x-F Grav]]
  <</if>>
<<else>>
  <<= $n1_naked ? "his naked self" : "himself">> in it.
  Not that he particularly <em>needs</em> to see his own
  <<= $n1_naked ? "slender, masculine body"
    : "fashionably-robed body">>,
  but the view also reveals an interesting arrangement of
  [[glowing crystals|n1x-F Grav]]
<</if>>
behind the cross that he's bound to.

<<if $n1_mageSight>>
  ?P
  The mirror also seems to be the only magic in the room
  with energy that Nero recognizes.
  Amid all the exotic energy,
  he sees an ordinary glow from the mirror's pyron node,
  <<if $n1_magicPhase < MP_wantDevice>>
    which is a device that he is quite familiar with!
    <<actions-add [["Try to tap the mirror's pyron node."|n1s-F Tap 1]]>>
  <<else>>
    and Nero has managed to tap it.
    ?P
    The pyron node provides the lupine mage with a small trickle of power.
    It isn't enough to replenish his own store of energy,
    but it's enough to keep his mage-sight active.
    ?P
    More importantly, tapping the node has granted him access to
    a Sprite!
    It's the tiniest of flaws in the panther's magic defenses,
    but it might be all that Nero needs to escape!
