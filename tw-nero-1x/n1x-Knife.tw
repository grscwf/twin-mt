    Nero is holding an ordinary letter opener.
  <<else>>
    The letter opener is on the floor where Nero dropped it.
  <</if>>
  <<if $n_mageSight>>
    There's nothing magical about it.
  <</if>>
  The blade is probably steel, and it
  <<if $n_tooClever>>
    seems sharp enough to cut leather.
  <<else>>
    was sharp enough to cut his leather bonds.
  <</if>>
  But it isn't much sharper than the wolf's teeth,
  and it lacks a grip, which makes
  it awkward as a weapon,
  especially since Nero has little training in the use of a blade in combat.
  ?P
  Still, there are many reasons a steel blade might be
  helpful, especially when the wolf
  <<if $n_mageSight>>
    only has limited use of his own magic.
  <<else>>
    is unable to use his own magic yet.
  <</if>>

<<else>>
  Amid the clutter of the
  <<if $n_candleLit>>
    desk, near the side furthest from the
    <<mta-no-loop "n1x Candle">>flickering red candle<</mta-no-loop>>,
  <<else>>
    desk
  <</if>>
  is a letter opener.
  <<if $n_mageSight>>
    There's no sign of magic in it,
  <<else>>
    It's unadorned,
  <</if>>
  and it's probably made of steel.

    Nero keeps a knife of his own in his robes.
    Cutting is often needed when preparing spells.
    <<if $n_naked>>
      But since he's no longer wearing his robes (or anything else),
    <<else>>
      But it's likely that Ivex has already removed the wolf mage's weapons, so
    <</if>>
    it's good to know that the letter opener is nearby,
    if he ever has a
    <<if $n_subby>>
      reason to need it.
    <<else>>
      chance to reach it.
    <</if>>

  <<else>>
    One edge of it seems like it might be sharp enough
    to cut Nero's leather bonds.
    ?P
    Too bad it's on the desk, far out of reach.
    <<if $n_bottleViewed>>
      ?P
      But perhaps <em>it</em> could reach <em>him</em>,
      if the wolf mage can find a way to use
      Nackle's Device inside the
