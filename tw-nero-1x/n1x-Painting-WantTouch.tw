  Fortunately, her mouth

  seem to be the hole that the Sprite

  him to touch.

  The wolf can't stop staring at her face,
  and he can't help but wonder...
  Is the portrait's mouth the hole that the Sprite
  <<= $n2_free ? "wanted" : "wants">>
  him to touch?
  It's a disturbing idea. But Ivex is a disturbing panther.

    Well, there's no way to test that theory now.

    He was quite hostile when Nero accidentally guessed
    her name. The wolf does not think mentioning her again
    is a good idea. Hopefully, the hole is something else.

  The wolf has a wild thought.
  Could it be that the portrait's mouth
  is the hole that the Sprite
  <<= $n2_free ? "wanted" : "wants">>
  him to touch?
  <<if $n2_ivexGone>>
    It's a strange idea. But Ivex is a strange panther.

    Well, there's no way to test that theory now.

    And could Ivex be persuaded to
    touch it?
    ?P
    It's a strange idea. But Ivex is a strange panther.
