Time is passing.
Ivex, that pathetic panther,
<b id="clue-cut"></b>
could return at any moment.

?P
Well, let him. Nero can prepare for that.
The wolf remembers the letter opener is nearby,
and he can wield it with
<<if $n_tooClever>>
  Nackle while his hands stroke his cock.
<<else>>
  the hand that isn't stroking his cock.
<</if>>

?P
No. The blade will be too quick.
In order to punish Ivex the way he deserves,
Nero will need to immobilize and disable the panther.
At the first sign of teleportation, as soon as
<<if $n_mageSight>>
  the exotic energy mesh begins to warp,
<<else>>
  the air begins to crackle,
<</if>>
the wolf will leap to grab the panther's throat
and choke it as hard as he's choking his own cock.

?P
Ivex will struggle and try to cast a spell, but fail.
The panther's eyes will plead with fear and desperation
as he slips into unconsciousness
and Nero ejaculates <em>again</em>.
This time, the wolf does not stop his strokes.
He pulls and squeezes to coax every drop of pleasure
from his enthusiastic cock.

?P
And it still isn't enough.
Nero considers another scenario,
another way the panther might fight back.
The wolf plots out each move and countermove like a chess game.
He considers every possible tactic Ivex might try,
and for every action that the panther makes,
Nero can see clearly what to do next.
He knows all the right responses that will lead to triumph
and satisfaction for his cock.

?P
