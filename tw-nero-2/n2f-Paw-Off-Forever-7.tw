Nero has lost count of how many
<b id="clue-cut"></b>
times he's cum,
but it doesn't matter.
He isn't even <em>trying</em> to orgasm now.
The continuous stimulation of his cock is just something to
keep his hands occupied as he plans every step of every
possible path to the panther's inevitable defeat.

  ?P
  He hears, he imagines the Sprite speaking.
  <span class=sprite-q>"You have been idle for
  not a number minutes, ?master
  I am going to disconnect and sleep, ?master"</span>
  ?P
  Yes, that's also a scenario to consider.
  The Sprite was a good bit of luck,
  but there's no way of knowing how long the luck will last.
  Nero should have plans for what to do <em>without</em>
  the power of the Sprite.
  He imagines he can see his mage-sight fading,
  and his vision returns to an ordinary,
  drab view of the room.

?P
All this planning and stroking is taking quite a bit of time,
but Nero is confident the time is well spent.
With every detail he anticipates of every fresh scenario
he imagines, his imminent revenge becomes better,
and it becomes even more impossible for the panther
to escape.

?P
Nero discovers more ways that Ivex might struggle.
The wolf chases every possibility,
no matter how unlikely or bizarre.
Whatever complicated actions Ivex might try,
Nero easily finds a response,
some countermove that will defeat the panther <em>anyway</em>.
