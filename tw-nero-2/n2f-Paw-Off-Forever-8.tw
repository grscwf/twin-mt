The wolf even imagines a door
<b id="clue-cut"></b>
opening, with Ivex on
the other side.
Perhaps the panther doesn't teleport in at all.
Nero is ready for <em>that</em> too.

?P
All he has to do is hide to one side of the door,
and wait.
Ivex will take a step into the room, and then pause.
He will notice that the wolf is <em>not</em> on the cross.
A moment later the panther will also realize that the
ridiculous cross has been completely destroyed.
Perhaps he'll gasp with surprise, or growl from frustration.

?P
And <em>that's</em> when Nero will reveal himself,
and strike, and cum.

?P
The wolf's imagination of that scenario is so vivid,
he can <em>smell</em> the panther. The scent
fills Nero's awareness as his hand rapidly urges
his rigid cock to climb the peak of that
ultimate, ecstatic victory again, and again, and again...

?P
