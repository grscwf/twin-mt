The wolf even considers what will happen if
<b id="clue-cut"></b>
the panther <em>doesn't</em> teleport back.
Perhaps a door opens with Ivex on the other side.
Well, Nero is ready for <em>that</em> too.

?P
All he has to do is hide to one side of the door,
and wait.
Ivex will take a step into the room, and then pause
when he notices that the wolf is <em>not</em> on the cross,
and in fact the ridiculous cross has been completely destroyed.
The panther might gasp with surprise or growl with frustration.

?P
And <em>that's</em> when Nero will reveal himself,
and strike, and cum.

?P
The wolf's imagination of that scenario is so vivid,
he can <em>smell</em> the panther. The scent
fills Nero's awareness as his hand rapidly urges
his rigid cock to climb the peak of that
ultimate, ecstatic victory again, and
again<<fade-in 300s>><span class=nobr>. . .</span>
