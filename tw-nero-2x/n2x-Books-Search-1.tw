  Nero had thought that the duplicated books were fakes intended
  to make the room more scholarly.
  But the ones he had pulled off the shelves are certainly real books.
  And the others all seem real as well.
<<else>>
  Nero suspects
  that the duplicated books are fakes intended to make the room
  look more scholarly.
  He touches one and is surprised to find it's an actual book.
  In fact, all of them seem to be actual books.

<<else>>
  Nero re-shelves the duplicates.

He then turns his attention
to the book he's <em>most</em> curious about.

<<if $n_pornSnuffed>>

<</if>>
stack of books near the desk.
<<if $n_wandExploded && !$n_pornSnuffed>>
  A few flames are slowly eating the edges of the untidy stack.
  Nero uses Nackle to stop the burning.

?P
What school <em>did</em> Ivex attend before Ransamaran Ivory?
Why was the investigator unable to find those records?

?P
He pulls
<<if $n_wandExploded && !$n_pornSnuffed>>
  the "Class of 621"
<<else>>
  that book
<</if>>
out from the stack...
