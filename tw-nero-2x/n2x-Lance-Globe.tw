snow globe into the air.
<<if $n_deskLanced && !$n_globeBroken>>
  It does not seem damaged by its fall from the desk.
<</if>>
He considers
<<= $n_globeBroken ? "pulverizing" : "smashing">>
it and throwing it out the window.
But that seems too simple a fate for such an aggravating object.

Never mind. He doesn't care. He bashes the globe against the wall,

<<elseif $n_deskCleared>>
  in the middle of the empty desk.
<<else>>
