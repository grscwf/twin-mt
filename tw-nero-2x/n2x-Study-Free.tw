<<if $n_wandExploded>>
  Much like Ivex himself, his study is strange and dirty,
  but it's now ruined by Nero's acts of destruction.
  The wolf hopes that he will soon be able to ruin
  the panther as well.
  ?P

<<elseif _chaos>>
  Much like Ivex himself, his study is strange and dirty,
  but the vulgar pretentiousness is greatly reduced by
  the not-so-carefully placed chaos that the wolf has inflicted.
  Too bad the destruction of furnishings in this room does not also
  destroy the furnishings of the panther's mind.
  ?P

<<else>>
  Much like Ivex himself, his study is pompous, strange, and dirty.

The only other furniture is a

And of course,
<<if $n_crossBurnLanced>>
  the smoky, reeking pile of charred wood scraps that used to be a cross.

  the cozy fire of wood scraps that used to be a cross.

<<elseif $n_crossLanced>>

  Nero scans the room for something to wear, but there doesn't seem to
  be anything suitable. He'll have to remain naked a bit longer.
