The ruthless verdict turned out to be premature.
When the council's official investigator Magister Winterdew
finally arrived on the scene,
she discovered that Nackle's magic had very little to do with the spirit realm,
and more to do with a novel and clever telekinetic installation.

?P
Nackle himself was not particularly strong in magic ability.
The magister's report mentions that an analysis of the charred skull
indicates that his spectral arc-weight could not be more than
<span class=nobr>30 Stalvers,</span>
which is perhaps enough to power a spell that can
levitate two small pebbles.

?P
The unfortunate mage's genius was in developing an extraordinary matrix
of lesser-known glyphs that bonds the
telekinetic energy field to the mesh of spectral power
within a room.
Once the matrix is installed,
contact with the construct allows a mage to telekinetically
move objects in the room with considerable force,
without draining the mage's own energies.
This then allowed Nackle to focus his attention on...
activities that Winterdew hinted at, but left unspecified in her report.
