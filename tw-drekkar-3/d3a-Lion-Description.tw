:: d3a Lion Description {"position":"11650,5200","size":"100,100"}
<<nobr>>

The lion is large with shiny golden fur and an impressive mane. He is also quite muscular, with thick arms and a broad chest, as made plain by the fact that he does not wear much in terms of clothing. What seems to be some kind of harness made of leather has some straps going across his chest and back, and below? Nothing. The lion does not wear anything to cover his rear that is plain for the wolf to see from where he stands.
