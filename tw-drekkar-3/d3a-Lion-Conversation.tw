Before the wolf can even properly finish speaking, however, the lion interrupts him.

?P
"I am directed to provide the means for one to take their place. Wait here."

?P
The lion finally puts down the mortar and pestle and, without saying anything, moves to one of the cabinets and pulls open a drawer. In it, the wolf can see a handful of <span class="imp-info">dim, gray gemstones</span>, of which the lion takes one.

?P

  The wolf's eyes grow wide! The words he read on Ivex's journal return to his mind. Empty gemstones... That might be what the wolf is looking for!
  ?P
  The lion, however, takes one and closes the drawer. He then walks towards the wolf. Drekkar tenses up for a moment, but the lion just walks past him and leaves the room. Confused, the wolf can at least see that he goes into the other room across the hallway. He's not sure what the lion is doing, but it's his chance!
  ?P
  In a rush, the wolf moves towards the drawer to open it and take a closer look. Indeed, it contains a handful of gray and dull-looking gemstones, but gemstones nevertheless. These must be the empty ones! The wolf's tail starts wagging, but before he can do anything with them, the sound of the lion returning forces him to quickly shut the drawer and step away as to avoid drawing suspicion.
  ?P
  When the feline returns, he no longer holds a gray gemstone, but rather a bright, blue one that glows just like the one hanging from the pendant around his neck. He must have enchanted it. That increases the wolf's hopes that those gemstones are what he is looking for. All he has to do now is not look suspicious and somehow deal with this lion so that he can get them...
  ?P
  The lion attaches a piece of string to it, and just like that, he has a makeshift pendant much like his own.

  He then walks towards the wolf. Drekkar tenses up for a moment, but the lion just walks past him and leaves the room. Confused, the wolf can at least see that he goes into the other room across the hallway.
  ?P
  It takes a few moments, but soon the lion returns and the dim gemstone he took with him now has a bright, blue glow. One that looks just like the one hanging from the pendant around the lion's neck. It is not surprising to see him attach it to a piece of string, quickly making a makeshift pendant out of it.

?P
"Take this and wear it," the lion offers, showing the pendant to the wolf. "You will need this to navigate the master's tower as you should."

?P
The wolf looks at the pendant but hesitates. The lion's eyes lock on the wolf, patiently waiting for him to take the pendant. His expression remains neutral, his eyes blank... but he seems to know what he's doing. Somehow.

?P
"What is your name? Do you work for Ivex?" the wolf tries asking.

?P
The lion, however, simply repeats what he says before.

?P
"Take this and wear it. You will need this to navigate the master's tower as you should."

?P
"What does that pendant do?" the wolf tries asking again.

?P
"Take this and wear it. You will need this to navigate the master's tower as you should."

?P
Drekkar frowns. There is no talking to this lion. Whatever Ivex has done to him... he's barely a person! Looking down at the pendant, Drekkar bites his lip.

?P
On one side, it looks dangerous. What did the lion say before about taking his place...? On the other side, it could be useful for navigating the tower, as well as to keep the lion nice and friendly.

?P
Apparently tired of waiting, the lion starts stepping forward, raising the pendant up and readying it to be put on the wolf's neck. A decision on how to approach this must be taken now.

?P
