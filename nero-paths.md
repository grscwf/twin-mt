# Nero paths <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a description of paths to all of Nero's endings.
I suggest you don't read this until you've played through
at least three different Nero ending variations.

Are you sure you want to see this?
Nero's story has many hints for all the endings,
and this description reveals many things that are
probably more fun to discover yourself.

<details>
  <summary>Yes, spoil me</summary>

## 1st Floor
- There are two solutions to the 1st floor: Easy and Hard.
- Hard requires doing the right things before Ivex leaves.
- Easy is available after Ivex leaves, if the player misses the Hard solution.

### 1st Floor Moods
Nero has 6 different moods when interacting with Ivex, and one more mood
after escaping the cross.
The moods are mostly flavor, affecting many descriptions.
There are only a few paths that require specific moods.
<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- Nero's initial choice is 3 options that converge on Ivex Intro, but each
  option gets there in a different mood/state: `normal`, `naked`, `abused`.
- (1) `normal` is the baseline mood.
- (2) `naked` is triggered when Ivex removes Nero's clothes.
  - `naked` is one of the initial choices, and it can also happen at
    several other points.
  - Nero is always `naked` before Ivex leaves.
  - Becoming `naked` also asks barbs/smooth. There are 4 variants:
    Mica, Pevhin, and a skip option if the player's already
    already seen Mica or Pevhin's story in a previous playthrough.
- (3) `abused` is triggered when Ivex punches Nero's balls
  before the candle is lit.
  - `abused` is one of the initial options, and it can also happen at
    several other points.
  - `abused` can be false when Ivex leaves.
- (4) `tough` is triggered by some choices after `abused`.
  - Nero decides he's not going to cave in to abuse.
  - This changes the text in several places, but doesn't change any paths.
- (5) `subby` is triggered by particular dialog choices.
  - Nero decides he wants to be, or pretend to be, an apprentice.
  - `subby` is needed for reaching one ending.
- (6) `candleHorny` is triggered when the candle has been lit long enough,
  and it goes away when the candle is snuffed or disabled.
  - Nero is not thinking clearly. Everything is affected.
- (7) `extraHorny` is triggered when Nero escapes the cross on
    the easy path.
  - Nero is continually distracted by his unnaturally erect cock.
  - `extraHorny` is normally false after doing the hard escape,
    but there are optional actions that can trigger it anyway.

</details>

### 1st Floor Easy Escape and Bad Ending: Tamed
The easy solution is 3 steps that can be done before or after Ivex leaves,
and 1 step done after he leaves.

It's a simple set of choices and actions.
The game strongly nudges the player in the right direction.

A player will probably find this on their 1st or 2nd playthrough.

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- At the Ivex-gone restart point, Nero is bound to the cross,
  and the candle relights itself.
- Most actions at this point are not useful.
  They're either teases, or they provide
  hints for the next attempt at the 1st Floor Hard solution.
- 2 looks or 1 action will trigger `candleHorny`.
- 4 looks or 2 actions will take the candle to near-max.
- At near-max, the next look or action will take candle to max,
  which forces the final choice.
- These actions can be done earlier, or can be done here:
  - (1-A) Try casting any spell.
  - (2-A) Cast mage-sight.
  - (3-L) See the energy web of the crystals with mage-sight.
    - If `candleHorny`, looking at the mirror is enough.
- (4-A) When the candle is at max, and Nero has seen the crystal
  energy web with mage-sight, struggling will disrupt the grav crystals.
  - Anything other than struggling will fail.
  - This is basically a 50/50 choice if the player misses the hints.
  - On failure, Nero is overwhelmed by lust, and Ivex returns.
    - Bad Ending: Tamed Mild - cooperate
    - Bad Ending: Tamed Harsh - resist
- After disrupting the grav crystals, there's a choice between
  getting the letter opener or the candle.
  Both options succeed. There's no trap here.
- If the mirror is tapped, it will get broken,
  making it unavailable on the 2nd Floor,
  and making the 2nd Floor Easy solution unavailable.

</details>

### 1st Floor Bad Ending: Caged
There are two Caged endings, which can happen after Nero
escapes the cross.

Caged Mild is always reachable from
the Ivex-gone restart point.

Caged Harsh is meant to be a little tricky,
and it might require restarting from the beginning.
There's a hint about it in the Archives.

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- Bad Ending: Caged Mild - paw off before leaving.
- Bad Ending: Caged Harsh - use wand before leaving.
  - This requires asking Ivex about the wand,
    which can be done when the Sprite wants touch or password.

</details>

### 1st Floor Hard Escape
The hard solution is ~11 steps that must be done before Ivex leaves.
It's designed to be unlikely to be found on the
1st playthrough, but not too hard to find after a few more playthroughs.

It's basically an information puzzle. There are a lot of things to look at
and poke at, but many of them are red herrings, and there's only a limited
amount of time to do the right sequence of actions.

Whenever a player does the easy solution, they can learn a few more steps
of the hard solution. They're likely to know the whole solution by
the 4th or 5th playthrough.

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- (1) Try casting any non-attack spell
  - Attack closes some conversation paths, which means there isn't enough
    time to do everything else.
  - It might take a few playthroughs to understand the effects of attack,
    but most players will probably avoid doing attack after it fails once.
- (2) Cast mage-sight.
- (3) Tap the mirror to get the Sprite.
  - This step isn't obvious, but it's unlikely to be missed.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 2rd playthrough.
- (4*) Look at the bottle, examine the glyphs.
  - This can be done earlier.
  - This is the only step that's just a look, not an action.
  - After a spell is cast, the player can also do (6) at the same time,
    saving a look.
- (5) Ask the Sprite to contact the bottle.
- Sprite now asks for device name.
- (6) Ask Ivex about the bottle to get the name.
  - This can sometimes be done at the same time as (4-L*), saving a look.
  - If Ivex has left, this will need another playthrough.
    But if the player is here on the 2nd playthrough, they've probably looked
    at the bottle early enough to have time to ask Ivex. So this probably
    doesn't need another playthrough.
- (7) Ask the Sprite to contact the bottle again.
- Sprite now asks Nero to touch its hole.
- (8) Ask Ivex about the penguin, when he's receptive.
  - This is a little tricky. There are several red herrings. It's possible
    that Ivex will leave before the player finds this.
  - If Ivex leaves, the Easy escape gives the player plenty of time to find
    hints to the hole.
  - "Ivex receptive" is also a little tricky. There are hints to it,
    but it might take a few tries to understand that an attack spell makes
    this impossible.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 4th playthrough.
- Sprite asks Nero for password, misinterprets something Nero said as the
  password, and puts Nero on hold.
- (9) Tell Sprite quiet, to get out of hold.
- (10) Guess any password.
- (11) Ask Ivex about the snow globe.
  - There are two varieties of this: `candleHorny` and not.
  - When `candleHorny`, player has to ask about the snow globe twice.
    - There's a small trick here. There are two look paths to the snow globe,
      and after the first ask, the shorter path is unavailable.
  - When not `candleHorny`, asking about the snow globe is only
    available after asking one passwords (not counting the initial
    automatic mistake), and it's no longer available after asking two.
  - The player is very unlikely to get this step right on 1st playthrough.
    There's no hint about this before all the other steps are fulfilled,
    and there are many other possible passwords.
  - If the player gets here, but doesn't succeed before Ivex leaves,
    the Easy escape automatically tells the player the right password.
- Player will probably be here on 2nd - 5th playthrough.
- The password is a big tease:
  - There's a moment when it seems like it might succeed,
    and then it becomes a big failure.
  - Player goes through another section that feels like "crap, another
    obstacle, what else do I have to do to get past this."
  - But this turns out to actually work anyway. Nero is free.
- The mirror is saved. It can be taken to the 2nd Floor and used there.

</details>

### 1st Floor Challenge Ending: Broken
This is the challenge ending on the first floor.
It's meant to be hard to find, but not impossible.
It will probably require careful exploration and understanding of
most of Nero's paths. There are subtle clues to it in various places,
and the Archives will give subtle hints.

<details>
  <summary>All the hints in the Archives</summary>

- If the player has not yet unlocked a Tamed ending:
  - "Another hint will appear after Nero has a disturbing dream..."
- If the player has not yet unlocked the Caged Mild ending:
  - "Another hint will appear after Nero gets stuck in a red glow..."
- If the player has not yet escaped with the mirror:
  - "Another hint will appear after Nero stops saying please..."
- If the player has not yet noticed what Ivex forgot:
  - "Does Nero know a spell that can escape Ivex's wand?"
- If the player has not yet noticed the glitch:
  - "Barbs or smooth... Is there a third choice?"
- Final hint:
  - "You know all the pieces of the puzzle.
    Can Nero use his spell to escape Ivex's wand?"

</details>

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- You must have seen Mica already in other playthroughs.
- Pick the neutral or abused start. (Do not cast Endgame).
- Follow the dialog branches to becoming an apprentice.
- When Ivex removes Nero's clothes, use the 3rd option.
- Demonstrate Nero's best spell.
- Make sure to ask about the wand before Ivex leaves.
- Finish the hard escape *before* becoming horny.
  - This is tight timing. It might take a few tries
    to find a path that works.
- Use the wand.

</details>

## 2nd Floor
Under construction. This is the tentative plan, not implemented yet.

There are two solutions to the 2nd floor: Easy and Hard.

### 2nd Floor Easy Escape
The easy solution requires doing the 1st Floor Hard Escape.
It has 4 steps, and it's very easy, basically a reward for
finding 1st Floor Hard.

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- Player has done 1st Floor Hard. Nero escaped 1st floor and has the mirror.
- (1) Read spellbook to find out about gems and the teleport spell.
- (2) Use mirror and poltergeist device in lion room to immobilize lion.
  The lion doesn't stay immobilized, but you can repeat it forever.
- (3) Get a blank gem from the lion room.
- (4) Energize the gem with teleport.
- (5) Teleport out.

</details>

### 2nd Floor Hard Escape
The hard solution has 14 steps.
It's basically a clockwork timing puzzle.
It's a little tricky, but there are several retryable loops,
so it's pretty forgiving.

The bad endings here don't have much warning, but once a player has
reached a bad ending, it's pretty obvious how to avoid it on the
next playthrough.

The player will probably need a few playthroughs to get this right.
The choices are pretty narrow, so it's probably easier than 1st Floor Hard.

<details>
   <summary>Full description</summary>

- Nero escaped 1st floor but doesn't have the mirror.
- Nero needs the gem in the blob.
  - Nero is not going to enter the blob without a way to escape, which is
    wearing the ring.
  - The ring has a short timer:
    - Wearing it makes it glow green.
    - After one action, it glows yellow.
    - If Nero doesn't take it off when it's yellow, it turns red and locks on.
      - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Mild - lion is not following or hunting.
      - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Harsh - lion is following.
      - Bad Ending: Wrecked - lion is hunting.
  - Entering the blob alone will not get the gem.
    - This can be repeated, as long as the player removes the ring after.
    - After two failures, suggest doing something else.
  - Nero needs to get the lion to enter the blob with him, which distracts
    the blob enough to let Nero get the gem.
    - Nero is not able to overpower the lion.
    - Nero has to get the lion to chase him into the blob.
  - The lion has two chase modes:
    - "Follow" is slow and relentless.
      - Nero can evade the lion indefinitely in a room, and take any number
        of actions in the room.
      - Moving to another room will drop everything Nero is holding, but not
        the ring if he's wearing it.
      - The lion is not going to chase Nero into the blob.
    - "Hunt" is fast and feral:
      - After any action, Nero is forced into an adjacent room after dropping
        everything (but not the ring, if he's wearing it).
      - The lion will chase Nero into the blob.
    - TODO: getting into hunt mode is a dialog maze. Nero has to find the
      right way to confuse the lion's instructions.
    - TODO: need a timing subtlety that allows Nero to get both enthralled and
      hunted while wearing ring
  - Nero has to start the lion hunting before wearing the ring. The other
    order never works:
    - Put on ring, it turns green.
    - Start lion hunting, ring turns yellow and Nero is starting to feel stiff.
    - Any action other than removing the ring will fail to evade the lion.
      - Bad Ending: Wrecked. (and thrall is involved somehow)
  - To enter the blob with the lion:
    - Nero has to be wearing the ring, and the lion has to be hunting.
    - He can't start this in the Extraction room:
      - Start lion hunting.
      - Put on ring, it turns green, the lion hunts him into the Hallway.
      - Move back to extraction room, the ring turns yellow.
      - He now has to take off the ring, or get caught by the lion.
    - So Nero has to start in the hallway:
      - Start lion hunting.
      - Put on ring, it turns green, lion hunts him into the Extraction room.
      - Dive into the blob, lion chases him in.
  - The next problem is, the door to the Extraction room is on a timer.
    - From the Hallway, touching the gem on the door will cause it to play
      a fanfare, then open the next turn, then close the turn after.
    - This is what the statue is for.
      - Pulling down the statue will start it falling.
      - Next turn, Nero starts the lion hunting. The statue hits the door gem,
        and the door opens.
      - Nero puts on the ring, the door is still open, the lion hunts him
        into the extraction room.
  - Note: it isn't possible to escape if the player starts the lion hunting
    earlier.
    - To keep the dead-end short, Nero loses the ring entirely if he's holding
      it, not wearing it, when hunted into another room.
    - TODO: This still might be too frustrating? Add generous hints on this
      failure path, or maybe simplify the puzzle by removing the door delay
      entirely.
- This is the complete list of steps needed to escape:
  - (1) Read journal, to find out about the gem in blob.
  - (2) Look at blob, see the gem.
  - (3) Find the ring.
  - (4) Optional: Drop ring in hallway.
  - (5) Talk to lion, start lion following.
  - (6) If holding ring, wear ring, it's now green.
  - (7) Go to hallway, ring is now yellow.
  - (8) Remove ring, or pick up ring.
  - (9) Pull Ivex statue, which starts falling.
  - (10) Talk to lion, start lion in "hunt" mode. Statue falls on door.
    Door opens.
  - (11) Wear ring, it's now green. Door is open, and lion hunts Nero into
    Extraction room.
  - (12) Dive into blob, lion jumps in too.
  - (13) Lion distracts blob long enough that Nero can get the gem.
  - (14) Teleport out. Once Nero is out, he has magic back and can defuse
    the ring.
- Ways to fail
  - Wear the ring too long:
    - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Mild - lion is not following or hunting.
    - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Harsh - lion is following.
    - Challenge Ending: Wrecked - lion is hunting 
      (and probably Thrall is involved).
  - Lose ring while hunted:
    - Bad Ending: Hunted Mild - cooperate.
    - Bad Ending: Hunted Harsh - resist.
  - Nene of these failures has much warning before it happens,
    but once the player knows they can happen, they're easy to avoid:
    - Take off the ring as soon as it's yellow.
    - Don't activate lion hunting until everything is ready.
- So this is solvable on 1st - 4th playthrough (1st: fail 1F escape, 2nd: fail
  with ring, 3rd: fail with lion), but the timing puzzle may take several tries
  to get right.
