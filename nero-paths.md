This is a description of paths to all of Nero's endings.
I suggest you don't read this until you've played through
at least three different Nero ending variations.

Are you sure you want to see this?
Nero's story has many hints for all the endings,
and this description reveals many things that are
much more fun to discover yourself.

    Yes, spoil me
  </summary>

## 1st Floor
- There are two solutions to the 1st floor: Easy and Hard.
- Hard requires doing the right things before Ivex leaves.
- Easy is available after Ivex leaves, if the player misses the Hard solution.

### 1st Floor Moods
Nero has 5 different moods when interacting with Ivex, and one more mood
after escaping the cross. The moods are mostly flavor.
There's only one path that requires a specific mood.
<details>

- Nero's initial choice is 3 options that converge on Ivex Intro, but each
  option gets there in a different mood/state.
  - (1) Ivex punches Nero's balls, which puts Nero in "abused" mood.
    - "abused" affects many descriptions, but doesn't change paths
      except in one place.
    - Several later choices can also make Ivex angry and trigger "abused".
  - (2) Ivex removes Nero's clothes, which puts Nero in "naked" mood.
    - "naked" just affects descriptions.
    - At several later points, Ivex will remove Nero's clothes if he's
      not already naked.
    - Nero is always naked before Ivex leaves.
    - Becoming naked also asks barbs/smooth. There are 4 variants of this:
      Mica, Pevhin, glitch, and a skip-story option if the player's already
      seen that story in a previous playthrough.
  - (3) "normal" mood. Neither "abused" or "naked".
- (4) The mood "subby" can be triggered by taking the right choices when
  talking to Ivex. This is needed for reaching one ending.
- (5) The mood "candleHorny" is triggered when the candle has been lit for
  a while. This changes most descriptions, and some actions.
- (6) The mood "extraHorny" is triggered when Nero escapes the cross on
  the easy path. It's normally off on the hard path, but there's an
  optional action that can trigger it anyway.
  This changes some descriptions, and a few actions.
</details>

### 1st Floor Easy
The easy solution is 4 steps that can be done
before or after Ivex leaves, and 1 step that
must be done after he leaves.

It's a simple sequence of choices and actions.
The game strongly nudges the player in the right direction.

A player will probably find this on their 1st or 2nd playthrough.

<details>

- At the Ivex-gone restart point, Nero is bound to the cross, Ivex is gone, the
  candle is lit.
- Player can do 6 looks and 3 actions before the candle is maxed.
- Most actions here are not useful. They're either teases, or they provide
  hints for the next attempt at 1st Floor Hard.
- These actions can be done earlier, or can be done here:
  - (1) Try casting any spell.
  - In any order:
    - (2) Cast mage-sight.
    - (3) Look at the mirror to see the grav crystals.
  - (4) Look at the grav crystals with mage-sight.
  - Optional: Ask Ivex about the grav crystals before he leaves, for a hint.
- (5) When the candle is at max, and Nero has seen the grav crystals with
  mage-sight, Struggle will disrupt the grav crystals.
  - Anything other than struggling will fail.
  - This is basically be a 50/50 choice if the player misses the hints.
  - On failure, Nero is overwhelmed by lust, and Ivex returns.
    - Bad Ending: Tamed Mild - cooperate
    - Bad Ending: Tamed Harsh - resist
- After disrupting the grav crystals, there's a choice between getting the knife
  first or snuffing the candle first. Unlike Drekkar's story, both options
  succeed. There's no trap here.
- Easy solution will break the mirror, making it unavailable on the 2nd Floor,
  and making the 2nd Floor Easy solution unavailable.
- There are additional Bad Endings here:
  - Bad Ending: Caged Mild - paw off before leaving.
  - Bad Ending: Caged Harsh - paw off with wand before leaving. This is meant
    to be a little hard to find.
</details>

### 1st Floor Hard
The hard solution has 9 steps that must be done before Ivex leaves.
It's designed to be unlikely to be found on the
1st playthrough, but not too hard to find after a few more playthroughs.

It's basically an information puzzle. There are a lot of things to look at
and poke at, but many of them are red herrings, and there's only a limited
amount of time to do the right sequence of actions.

Whenever a player does the easy solution, they can learn a few more steps
of the hard solution. They're likely to know the whole solution by
the 4th or 5th playthrough.

<details>

- (1) Look at the bottle, discover it's a poltergeist device.
  - This should be easy. There are a lot of distractions, but there's plenty
    of time to stumble onto it.
  - If the player doesn't find it on 1st playthrough, they might fail the easy
    escape. 2nd playthrough should pass the easy escape, which gives a lot more
    time to look around and find the poltergeist device.
- These steps can be done before (1):
  - (2) Try casting any spell.
  - (3) Cast mage-sight.
  - (4) Tap the mirror to get the Sprite.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 2rd playthrough.
- (5) Ask the Sprite to contact the poltergeist device.
- Sprite now asks for device name.
- (6) Ask Ivex about the poltergeist device to get the name.
  - This can be done earlier, anytime after (1).
  - It's possible for this to need another playthrough, if Ivex has left.
    But if the player is here on the 2rd playthrough, they've probably looked
    at the bottle early enough to have time to ask Ivex. So this probably
    doesn't need another playthrough.
- (7) Ask the Sprite to contact the named device.
- Sprite now asks Nero to touch its hole.
- (8) Ask Ivex about the penguin.
  - This is a little tricky. There are several red herrings. It's possible
    that Ivex will leave before the player finds this.
  - If Ivex leaves, the Easy escape gives the player plenty of time to find
    hints to the hole.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 3rd playthrough.
- Sprite now asks Nero for password.
- (9) Ask Ivex about the snow globe.
  - This is very unlikely to happen on 1st playthrough. There's no hint about
    this before all the other steps are finished, and there are many other
    possible passwords.
  - If the player doesn't get this before Ivex leaves, the Easy escape
    automatically gives the player the password.
- Player will probably be here on 2nd - 4th playthrough.
- The password is a big tease:
  - There's a moment when it seems like it succeeds, and then it becomes
    another failure.
  - Ivex catches on to what the player is doing, denies access to the password,
    and applies extreme torture with another grav crystal.
  - Player goes through another section that feels like "crap, another
    obstacle, what else do I have to do to get past this."
  - But this turns out to actually work anyway. Nero is free.
- The mirror is saved. It can be used for 2nd Floor Easy escape.
- There's a Challenge Ending here that's meant to be hard to find.

</details>

### Challenge Ending: Broken
This is the challenge ending on the first floor.
There are clues to it, but it's meant to be
hard to find.
<details>

- You must have seen Mica and Pevhin already in other playthroughs.
- Pick the neutral starting option (not naked or abused).
- Follow the dialog branches to subby. You should get the "Barbs?" glitch.
- Finish the hard escape.
- Use the wand.

</details>

## 2nd Floor
- Under construction. This is the plan, not implemented yet.
- There are two solutions to the 2nd floor: Easy and Hard.

### 2nd Floor Easy
The easy solution requires doing the 1st Floor Hard solution.
It has 4 steps, and it's very easy, basically a reward for
finding 1st Floor Hard.

<details>

- Player has done 1st Floor Hard. Nero escaped 1st floor and has the mirror.
- (1) Read spellbook, to find out about gems and teleport spell.
- (2) Use mirror and poltergeist device in lion room to immobilize lion.
- (3) Get a blank gem from the lion room.
- (4) Energize the gem with teleport.
- (5) Teleport out.
</details>

### 2nd Floor Hard
The hard solution has 14 steps.
It's basically a clockwork timing puzzle.
It's a little tricky, but there are several retryable loops,
so it's pretty forgiving.

The bad endings here don't have much warning, but once a player has
reached a bad ending, it's pretty obvious how to avoid it on the
next playthrough.

The player will probably need a few playthroughs to get this right.
The choices are pretty narrow, so it's probably easier than 1st Floor Hard.

<details>

- Nero escaped 1st floor but doesn't have the mirror.
- This is a somewhat tricky timing puzzle.
- Nero needs the gem in the blob.
  - Nero is not going to enter the blob without a way to escape, which is
    wearing the ring.
  - The ring has a short timer:
    - Wearing it makes it glow green.
    - After one action, it glows yellow.
    - If Nero doesn't take it off when it's yellow, it turns red and locks on.
      - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Mild - lion is not following or hunting.
      - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Harsh - lion is following.
      - Bad Ending: Wrecked - lion is hunting.
  - Entering the blob alone will not get the gem.
    - This can be repeated, as long as the player removes the ring after.
    - After two failures, suggest doing something else.
  - Nero needs to get the lion to enter the blob with him, which distracts
    the blob enough to let Nero get the gem.
    - Nero is not able to overpower the lion.
    - Nero has to get the lion to chase him into the blob.
  - The lion has two chase modes:
    - "Follow" is slow and relentless.
      - Nero can evade the lion indefinitely in a room, and take any number
        of actions in the room.
      - Moving to another room will drop everything Nero is holding, but not
        the ring if he's wearing it.
      - The lion is not going to chase Nero into the blob.
    - "Hunt" is fast and feral:
      - After any action, Nero is forced into an adjacent room after dropping
        everything (but not the ring, if he's wearing it).
      - The lion will chase Nero into the blob.
    - TODO: need a timing subtlety that allows Nero to get both enthralled and
      hunted while wearing ring
  - Nero has to start the lion hunting before wearing the ring. The other
    order never works:
    - Put on ring, it turns green.
    - Start lion hunting, ring turns yellow and Nero is starting to feel stiff.
    - Any action other than removing the ring will fail to evade the lion.
      - Bad Ending: Wrecked. (and thrall is involved somehow)
  - To enter the blob with the lion:
    - Nero has to be wearing the ring, and the lion has to be hunting.
    - He can't start this in the Extraction room:
      - Start lion hunting.
      - Put on ring, it turns green, the lion hunts him into the Hallway.
      - Move back to extraction room, the ring turns yellow.
      - He now has to take off the ring, or get caught by the lion.
    - So Nero has to start in the hallway:
      - Start lion hunting.
      - Put on ring, it turns green, lion hunts him into the Extraction room.
      - Dive into the blob, lion chases him in.
  - The next problem is, the door to the Extraction room is on a timer.
    - From the Hallway, touching the gem on the door will cause it to play
      a fanfare, then open the next turn, then close the turn after.
    - This is what the statue is for.
      - Pulling down the statue will start it falling.
      - Next turn, Nero starts the lion hunting. The statue hits the door gem,
        and the door opens.
      - Nero puts on the ring, the door is still open, the lion hunts him
        into the extraction room.
  - Note: it isn't possible to escape if the player starts the lion hunting
    earlier.
    - To keep the dead-end short, Nero loses the ring entirely if he's holding
      it, not wearing it, when hunted into another room.
    - TODO: This still might be too frustrating? Add generous hints on this
      failure path, or maybe simplfiy the puzzle by removing the door delay
      entirely.
- This is the complete list of steps needed to escape:
  - (1) Read journal, to find out about the gem in blob.
  - (2) Look at blob, see the gem.
  - (3) Find the ring.
  - (4) Optional: Drop ring in hallway.
  - (5) Talk to lion, start lion following.
  - (6) If holding ring, wear ring, it's now green.
  - (7) Go to hallway, ring is now yellow.
  - (8) Remove ring, or pick up ring.
  - (9) Pull Ivex statue, which starts falling.
  - (10) Talk to lion, start lion in "hunt" mode. Statue falls on door.
    Door opens.
  - (11) Wear ring, it's now green. Door is open, and lion hunts Nero into
    Extraction room.
  - (12) Dive into blob, lion jumps in too.
  - (13) Lion distracts blob long enough that Nero can get the gem.
  - (14) Teleport out. Once Nero is out, he has magic back and can defuse
    the ring.
- Ways to fail
  - Wear the ring too long:
    - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Mild - lion is not following or hunting.
    - Bad Ending: Overwhelmed Harsh - lion is following.
    - Challenge Ending: Wrecked - lion is hunting 
      (and probably Thrall is involved).
  - Lose ring while hunted:
    - Bad Ending: Hunted Mild - cooperate.
    - Bad Ending: Hunted Harsh - resist.
  - Neither of these has much warning before it happens, but once the player
    knows they can happen, they're easy to avoid:
    - Take off the ring as soon as it's yellow.
    - Don't activate lion hunting until everything is ready.
- So this is solvable on 1st - 4th playthrough (1st: fail 1F escape, 2nd: fail
  with ring, 3rd: fail with lion), but the timing puzzle may take several tries
  to get right.
