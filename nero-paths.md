# Nero paths

## 1st Floor
- There are two solutions to the 1st floor: Easy and Hard.
- Hard requires doing the right things before Ivex leaves.
- Easy is available after Ivex leaves, if the player misses the Hard solution.

### 1st Floor Easy
- At the restart point, Nero is bound to the cross, Ivex is gone, the lust candle is lit.
- Player can do N looks and M actions before the lust candle is maxed.
- Most actions here are not useful. They're either teases, or they provide hints for the next attempt at 1st Floor Hard.
- These actions can be done earlier, or can be done here:
  - (1) Try casting any spell.
  - (2) Cast mage-sight.
  - (3) Look at the mirror.
  - (4) Look at the gems.
  - Optional: Ask Ivex about the grav gems before he leaves, which provides a hint.
- (5) When the lust candle is at max, and Nero has seen the grav gems with mage-sight, Struggle with desperate strength will disrupt the grav gems.
  - Anything other than struggling will fail.
  - This should basically be a 50/50 choice if the player misses the hints.
  - On failure, Nero is overwhelmed by lust. Ivex returns.
  - Player has a choice of Bad Ending: Tamed Mild and Tamed Harsh.
- After disrupting the grav gems, there's a choice between getting the knife first or snuffing the candle first.
  - Unlike Drekkar's story, both options are successful. There's no trap here.
- Easy solution will break the mirror, making it unavailable on the 2nd Floor, and making the 2nd Floor Easy solution unavailable.
- There's an additional Bad Ending here:
  - After escaping with high lust, look at the wand and use it.
  - This is Tamed Desperate.
  - It's meant to be a little hard to find.

### 1st Floor Hard
- This is designed to be almost impossible to do on 1st playthrough, but not too hard after a few playthroughs.
- (1) Look at the bottle, discover it's a poltergeist device.
  - This should be easy. There's a lot of chaff, but there's plenty of time to stumble onto it.
  - If the player doesn't find it on 1st playthrough, 2nd playthrough might fail to escape. 3rd playthrough should escape, which gives a lot more time to look around and find the poltergeist device.
- These steps can be done before (1):
  - (2) Try casting any spell.
  - (3) Cast mage-sight.
  - (4) Connect to the Sprite.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 3rd playthrough.
- (5) Ask the Sprite for access to the poltergeist device.
- Sprite now asks for device name.
- (6) Ask Ivex about the poltergeist device to get the name.
  - This can be done earlier, anytime after (1).
  - It's possible this will require another playthrough, if Ivex has left already.
  - But if the player is here on the 3rd playthrough, they've probably looked at the bottle early enough to have time to ask Ivex. So this probably doesn't need another playthrough.
- (7) Ask the Sprite for access to the named device.
- Sprite now asks Nero to touch the hole.
- (8) Ask Ivex about the cards.
  - This is a little tricky. There are several red herrings. It's possible that Ivex will leave before the player finds this.
  - If Ivex leaves, the Easy escape gives the player plenty of time to find the hole.
- Player will probably be here on 1st - 4th playthrough.
- Sprite now asks Nero for password.
- (9) Ask Ivex about the snow globe.
  - This is very unlikely to happen on 1st playthrough. There's no hint about this before all the other steps are finished, and there are many other possible passwords.
  - If the player doesn't get this before Ivex leaves, the Easy escape automatically gives the player the password.
- Player will probably be here on 2st - 5th playthrough.
- The password is a big tease:
  - There's a moment when it seems like it succeeds, and then it becomes another failure.
  - Ivex catches on to what the player is doing, denies access to the password, and applies extreme torture with another grav ball.
  - Lead the player through a section that feels like "crap, another obstacle, what else do I have to do to get past this."
  - But this turns out to actually work anyway. Nero is free.
- The mirror is saved. It can be used for 2nd Floor Easy escape.

## 2nd Floor
- There are two solutions to the 2nd floor: Easy and Hard.
- Easy is only available after finishing 1st Floor Hard.
- Hard is tricky, but a little forgiving, and maybe easier than 1st Floor Hard.
  - There are several retryable loops.
  - The player can easily avoid a bad ending that they've stumbled into before. The action that leads to the bad ending is obvious, and there's always an alternative.
  - The bad endings aren't necessarily obvious beforehand. This helps amp up frustration against Ivex and make the good ending more satisfying.

## 2nd Floor Easy
- Player has done 1st Floor Hard. Nero has escaped the 1st floor and has the mirror.
- (1) Read spellbook, to find out about gems and teleport spell.
- (2) Use mirror and poltergeist device in lion room to immobilize lion.
- (3) Get a blank gem from the lion room.
- (4) Energize the gem.

## 2nd Floor Hard
- Nero has escaped the 1st floor but doesn't have the mirror.
- This is a somewhat tricky timing puzzle.
- Nero needs the gem in the blob.
  - Nero is not going to enter the blob without a way to escape, which is wearing the ring and using a rope.
  - The ring has a short timer:
    - Wearing it makes it glow green.
    - After one action, it glows yellow.
    - If Nero doesn't take it off when it's yellow, it turns red and locks on. This is Bad Ending: Stiffened Harsh (lion is hunting) or Mild (lion is not hunting).
  - Entering the blob alone will not get the gem.
    - This can be repeated a few times, as long as the player remembers to remove the ring after.
    - After two failures, suggest doing something else.
  - Nero needs to get the lion to enter the blob with him, which distracts the blob enough to let Nero get the gem.
    - Nero is not able to overpower the lion.
    - Nero has to get the lion to chase him, and wrestle him into the blob.
  - The lion has two chase modes:
    - "Make drone" is slow and relentless.
      - Nero can evade the lion indefinitely in a room, and take any number of actions in the room.
      - Moving to another room will drop everything Nero is holding, but not the ring if he's wearing it.
      - The lion is not going to dive into the blob if Nero does.
    - "Hunt" is fast and feral:
      - After any action, Nero is forced into an adjacent room after dropping everything (but not the ring, if he's wearing it).
      - If Nero dives into the blob, the lion does too.
  - Nero has to be wearing the ring to dive into the blob.
  - The lion has to be hunting.
  - If Nero puts on the ring in the Extraction room, the lion hunts him to the hallway, and then he has to take off the ring.
  - So Nero has to put the ring on in the hallway, and have the lion hunt him into the Extraction room.
  - So, the next problem is, the door to the Extraction room is on a timer.
    - From the Hallway, touching the gem on the door will cause it to play a fanfare, then open the next turn, then close the turn after.
    - This is what the statue is for.
      - Pulling down the statue will start it falling.
      - Next turn, Nero starts the lion hunting. The statue hits the door gem and the door opens.
      - Nero puts on the ring, the door is still open, the lion hunts him into the extraction room.
  - Note: it isn't possible to escape if the player starts the lion hunting earlier.
    - To keep the dead-end short, Nero loses the ring entirely if he's holding it, not wearing it, when hunted into another room.
    - TODO: This still might be too frustrating? Add generous hints on this failure path, or maybe simplfiy the puzzle by removing the door delay entirely.
- This is the complete list of steps needed to escape:
  - (1) Read journal, to find out about the gem in blob.
  - (2) Look at blob, see the gem.
  - (3) Find the ring.
  - (4) Optional: Drop ring in hallway.
  - (5) Talk to lion, start lion following in "make drone" mode.
  - (6) If holding ring, wear ring.
  - (7) Go to hallway.
  - (8) Remove ring, or pick up ring.
  - (9) Pull Ivex statue, which starts falling.
  - (10) Talk to lion, start lion in "hunt" mode. Statue falls on door. Door opens.
  - (11) Wear ring. Door is open, and lion hunts Nero into Extraction room.
  - (12) Dive into blob, lion jumps in too.
  - (13) Lion distracts blob long enough that Nero can get the gem.
  - (14) Teleport out. Once Nero is out, he has magic back and can defuse the ring.
- Ways to fail
  - Wear the ring too long - Bad Ending: Stiffened
  - Lose ring while hunted - Bad Ending: Hunted
  - Neither of these has much warning before it happens, but once the player knows they can happen, they're easy to avoid:
    - Take off the ring as soon as it's yellow.
    - Don't activate lion hunting until everything is set right.
- So this is solvable on 1st - 4th playthrough (1st: fail 1F escape, 2nd: fail with ring, 3rd: fail with lion), but the timing puzzle may take several tries to get right.
